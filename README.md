# united-states-of-browsers
A project to combine &amp; organize history and bookmarks across multiple browsers and browser profiles.

The project idea is, essentially, I use multiple browsers and multiple browser profiles. This scatters my history, bookmarks across multiple interfaces. 

Whenever I wish to search something, I have to go through them all until I find them. I wish to build a tool which will read browser profile files and combine the history and bookmarks list, ready to be searched and organized automatically.

Initial idea is to read the broswer's sqlite3 database files and copy and combine the data in one place, maybe a json. More features for searching and organization and maybe an ML algo to recommend from within the combined history and the web will be implemented.
